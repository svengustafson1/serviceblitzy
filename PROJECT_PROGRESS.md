## Issues & Challenges
- Some image URLs from Unsplash returned 404 errors (fixed by using alternative images)
- Need to ensure consistent styling across all components
- Need to implement proper state management for form handling (currently using static mock data)

- Need to integrate real-time features like notifications with WebSockets
- ~~Backend module errors: Currently experiencing "MODULE_NOT_FOUND" errors~~ (Fixed by creating placeholder route files)
- ~~Need to set up npm scripts for easily running the backend server~~ (Added dev script and migration script)
- ~~Port conflicts when running the backend server~~ (Fixed by implementing dynamic port selection)
- Stripe integration requires proper API keys and webhook configuration
- AWS S3 integration requires proper configuration and security measures
